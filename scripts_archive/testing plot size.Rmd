library(readxl); library(magrittr); library(tidyverse); library(ggrepel); library(rlist)

```{r data}
a <- tibble('a' = 1:5, 'b' = (5:1)^2, 'c' = c('one','one','two','one','two'))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(a, aes(a,b,colour = c)) + geom_point()
ggsave('test1.png', device = png(), width = 4, height = 4)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
