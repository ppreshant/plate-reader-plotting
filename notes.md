Notes of Plate reader analysis.

# Things to do

15/1/22
- Need to incorporate the inducer column in the basic_plots pipeline
- Make an `if` loop for when `Inducer %in% colnames(..)` make a dose response plot borrowed from dose_response_.

Short steps
[x] Check how the data is read in current script - Is Inducer read in properly?
[ ] port code from other branch : dose_response_.
